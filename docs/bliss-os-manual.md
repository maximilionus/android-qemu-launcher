# Install
1. Follow the [basic guide](../README.md#install) to install the OS.
2. Each VM startup, in GRUB, you should select the `BlissOS-XX.XX YYYY-MM-DD QEMO/KVM` boot entry. This will improve graphics performance and overall VM stability. It will also allow you to change the screen resolution and aspect ratio using the `video=WxH` [kernel parameter](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_parameters).
